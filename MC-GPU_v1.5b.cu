 *   \b MC-GPU [1-4] is a Monte Carlo simulation code that can generate synthetic radiographic
 *   images and computed tomography (CT) scans of realistic models of the human anatomy using the
 *   computational power of commodity Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) cards.
 *   The code implements a massively multi-threaded Monte Carlo simulation algorithm
 *   for the transport of x rays in a voxelized geometry. The x ray interaction models and material
 *   properties have been adapted from \b PENELOPE \b 2006 [5].
 * 
 * 
 *   \b MC-GPU was developed using the \b CUDA programming model from \b NVIDIA [6] to achieve 
 *   maximum performance on NVIDIA GPUs. The code can also be compiled with a standard C compiler
 *   to be executed in a regular CPU. 
 *   In a typical medical imaging simulation, the use of GPU computing with MC-GPU has been shown 
 *   to provide a speed up of between 20 and 40 times, compared to the execution on a single CPU core.
 * 
 *   The MC-GPU code has been described in different scientific publications [1-4].

 *    \section  sec_changes  List of modifications in different versions of the code 
 * 
 *      \subsection  sec_DBT  Version 1.5b (2017/06/28)
 *   
  *  - Added electronic noise and Swank factor for detected charges output
 *   - Anti-scatter grid based on Day and Dance, Phys Med Biol 28, pp. 1429-1433 (1983)
 *   - Binary tree-based geometry model to reduce memory use: voxel dose tally can't be used with binary tree!
 *
 *     \subsection  sec_DBT  Version 1.4 (2016/02/02)
 *   
 *   - Fixed density for each material: disabling the option to use a different density for each voxel (to reduce memory).
 *   - Enabled input of voxelized geometry file in binary format (single byte per voxel).
 *   - Selenium detector model with thickness, attenuation, fluorescence tracking.
 *   - User-defined rotation axis for the tomography scan (using Rodrigues rotation formula).

 *   - Enable translation of the voxelized geometry and of the image sensor within the detector plane.

 *
 *      \subsection  sec_changes_v13  Version 1.3 (release date: 2012/12/12)
 * 
 *   - Code upgraded to CUDA 5.0 (not compatible with previous versions of CUDA!).
 *   - Removed limit on the amount of projection images that can be simulated per CT scan (source and 
 *     detector parameters now stored in global memory and transferring to shared memory at run time 
 *     to avoid using the limited constant memory).
 *   - New material dose tally implemented to estimate the dose deposited in each material independently
 *     of the voxel dose tally (the voxel dose tally measures the dose in each material adding the energy 
 *     deposited in each voxel of that material within the defined voxelized region-of-interest).
 *   - Interaction loop re-organized to maximize performance (virtual interactions simulated before real ones).

 * 
 *     \section sec_Intro Code features
 *  
 *   In this section we provide a brief description of the features of the MC-GPU code. A
 *   more complete description of the code can be found in our published articles.
 *   important information regarding the operation of the code is provided as comments in the  
 *   input files of the sample simulations provided with the MC-GPU package.
 *   Detailed information on each function of the code can be found in the complete Doxygen 
 *   documentation of the source code
 * 
 *   The basic operation of the code consists in adapting the simulation input file 
 *   to describe the location and characteristics of the x ray source, define the CT trajectory
 *   (if any), list the materials to be used in the simulation, define the geometry of
 *   the x ray detector and, finally, specify the voxelized object file to be  
 *   used as the simulation material universe. 
 *   In the first line of the input file, the user can fix the total number of x rays that have 
 *   to be simulated (> 1e5 histories) or the total simulation time (maximum 1e5 seconds). 
 * 
 * 
 *   The coordinate system of the simulated world is determined by the input voxelized geometry.
 *   The origin of coordinates is assumed to be located at the lower-back corner of the voxelized 
 *   volume, and the axis are located on the vertices of the voxelized volume. 
 *   This means that the lower-back corner of the first voxel is on the origin and the 
 *   following voxels are located along the positive X, Y and Z axis (first quadrant).
 * 
 * 
 *   To simulate the atomic interactions, MC-GPU uses a database of material properties based on the 
 *   database from PENELOPE. A PENELOPE 2006 material file can be converted into an MC-GPU material
 *   file using the auxiliary utility "MC-GPU_create_material_data.f" provided with the MC-GPU 
 *   package. Pre-defined material files for a set of materials typically used in medical imaging  
 *   simulations are already provided in the folder "MC-GPU_material_files".
 * 
 * 
 *   The code includes two tally options: an \b image \b tally that creates projection x-ray images,
 *   and a radiation \b dose \b tally that estimates the dose deposited inside the patient model.
 *   MC-GPU does not currently simulate the transport of electrons and therefore the dose  
 *   deposition tally (KERMA tally rigorously) will not be accurate for high energies or near 
 *   material interfaces and small voxels.
 *   In the image tally the images are formed by counting the energy that enters a user-defined 2D 
 *   grid of pixels, which is a simple approximation to a noise-free flat-panel detector with
 *   100% detection efficiency. The pixel values have units of eV/cm^2.
 *   Four different images are reported at the end of the simulation, corresponding
 *   to the signal produced by x rays that did not interact between the source and the detector 
 *   (non-scattered), x rays that suffered a single Compton (inelastic) interaction, a single 
 *   Rayleigh (elastic) interaction, and multi-scattered x rays.
 *   The dose tally counts the energy deposited by each x ray track inside each voxel of the 
 *   geometry, within a user-defined volumetric region-of-interest (ROI). The average dose deposited 
 *   inside each voxel and in each material (and the associated statistical uncertainties) are reported 
 *   at the end of the simulation.
 * 
 * 
 *   MC-GPU can simulate a single projection image or a full CT scan.
 *   The CT is simulated generating many projection images around the static 
 *   voxelized geometry. Currently, the code is limited to perform a simple
 *   CT trajectory rotating around the Z axis. The user can specify the angular shift and longitudinal
 *   translation (pitch) of the source between each projection and also the distance between the 
 *   source and the axis of rotation (the axis is assumed to be parallel to the Z axis). 
 *   By now, the code does not simulate some relevant components of a CT scanner such as the 
 *   anti-scatter grid, a bow-tie filter or a curved detector (flat-panel detector only).
 * 
 * 
 *   The x ray source is defined as a point source emitting x rays with an energy randomly sampled 
 *   from the user-provided energy spectrum. The polyenergetic spectrum is efficiently sampled 
 *   using the Walker aliasing algorithm. The emitted cone beam is computationally
 *   collimated to produce a rectangular field on the detector plane, within the azimuthal and 
 *   polar angles specified by the user.
 *   The detector plane is automatically located at the specified distance right in front of the
 *   source focal spot, with the collimated cone beam pointing towards the geometric center of the detector.
 * 
 * 
 *   In order to optimize the particle tracking algorithm (ray-tracing) and minimize 
 *   the accesses to the slow GPU main memory, the photon trajectories across the voxels
 *   are computed using the Woodcock tracking algorithm.
 *   With this technique the photons perceive the geometry as a uniform medium
 *   composed of the material of the most attenuating voxel.
 *   In this way, the voxel boundaries do not have to be explicitly calculated and
 *   multiple voxels can be crossed in a single step.
 *   To keep the simulation unbiased, some of the interactions are considered
 *   "virtual" (i.e., do not change the photon energy or direction of movement),
 *   depending on the x ray energy and the actual material at the interaction site.
 *   In typical medical imaging simulations where the most attenuating material is cortical bone,
 *   the Woodcock tracking algorithm gives an speed up of almost one order of magnitude compared
 *   to computing voxel boundaries all the time. However, if the geometry includes a high
 *   density voxel, such as a metallic implant, the performance of the code can be severely 
 *   reduced because a large fraction of the sampled interactions will be virtual.
 *  
 * 
 *   The random number generator used in PENELOPE [5], RANECU, is also used in the GPU
 *   program. To ensure that the simulated tracks are not correlated, each thread initializes
 *   the generator to a unique position in the random sequence, far enough from the
 *   other threads, using the algorithm implemented in the seedsMLCG code [7].
 * 
 * 
 *   In a typical simulation, several thousand threads are launched simultaneously in
 *   the GPU, each one of them simulating a batch of several x ray tracks.
 *   If the code is compiled with MPI support (see below), multiple GPUs can be used in parallel. 
 *   The code will perform a short speed test to estimate the relative speed of each GPU used 
 *   in the simulation and then distribute the number of particles among the available GPUs correspondingly.
 *   If the user specified a time limit in the simulation, all the GPUs will simulate in parallel 
 *   for the allowed time. Since the code is already optimized to scale well in  
 *   thousands of GPU threads, it scales almost linearly with the number of GPUs in most 
 *   situations, with only a few seconds of overhead in the initialization of the multiple GPUs 
 *   and in the reduction of the final results.
 * 
 *  
 *  
 * 
 *    \section sec_output Code output
 *
 *   At the end of the simulation the code reports the tallied 3D dose distribution and the 
 *   final simulated images in RAW binary form, as 32-bits float values. The image data is provided 
 *   as a collection of five consecutive images corresponding to: total image (scatter+primaries), 
 *   primary particles, Compton, Rayleigh and multi-scatter. 
 *   The dose data is reported as two RAW files with the mean dose and twice the standard deviation
 *   of the dose in each voxel of the geometry respectively, within the input ROI.
 *   The average dose deposited in each material of the geometry is also reported to the standard output. 
 *   Organ doses can be obtained by post-processing the output dose file, knowing which voxel 
 *   corresponds to each organ.
 *   The pixel and voxel dose data values are stored with the X coordinate incrementing first, the Y 
 *   coordinate incrementing second, and the Z coordinate incrementing last.
 *   
 *   The program also reports the simulated images and the dose at the Z plane at the level of the x ray 
 *   source as ASCII text files. The ASCII output can be readily visualized with the GNUPLOT scripts 
 *   distributed with MC-GPU. The header section at the beginning of these text files provides the 
 *   information required to easily read the RAW binary files with IMAGEJ, OCTAVE or other programs. 
 *  
 * 
 * 
 *    \section sec_compilation Code compilation and execution
 *
 *   MC-GPU has been developed and tested only in the Linux operating system.
 *   A Makefile script is provided to compile the MC-GPU code in Linux.
 *   The CUDA libraries and the GNU GCC compiler must be previously installed.
 *   The Makefile may have to be edited to modify the library path.
 *   The code requires the "zlib.h" library to be able to open gzipped input files.
 *
 *
 *   MC-GPU uses CUDA to access NVIDIA GPUs but all the actual computations are coded
 *   in standard C.
 *   The code can only be executed in NVIDIA GPUs (CPU compatibility from initial versions when not defining -DUSING_CUDA not available).
 *   Defining the pre-processor variable "USING_MPI" (i.e., compiling with
 *   "-DUSING_MPI"), Message Passing Interface (MPI) library calls are used to share information 
 *   between multiple CPU threads in different computers. 
 *   Each MPI thread gets a unique id in the CPU and addresses a unique GPU.
 *   At the end of the simulation the images and doses tallied by the different GPUs are 
 *   reduced to form single output file equivalent to a sequential simulation of the same 
 *   number of particles.
 * 
 *   The code can be easily compiled executing the command "make" or running the provided 
 *   "./make.sh" script. 
 *   Optionally, the code can be executed from the command line with a command like this 
 *   (example using CUDA and MPI, openMPI library in this case):
 * \code 
 * nvcc -DUSING_MPI MC-GPU_v1.3.cu -o MC-GPU_v1.3.x -O3
 *  -use_fast_math -L/usr/lib/ -I. -I/usr/local/cuda/include 
 *  -I/usr/local/cuda/samples/common/inc -I/usr/local/cuda/samples/shared/inc/ 
 *  -I/usr/include/openmpi  -lmpi -lz --ptxas-options=-v 
 *  -gencode=arch=compute_20,code=sm_20 -gencode=arch=compute_30,code=sm_30
 * \endcode
 * 
 *   The same source code can also be compiled for a regular CPU using:
 * \code  
 * gcc -x c -O3 MC-GPU_v1.3.cu -o MC-GPU_v1.3_CPU.x -I./ -lm -lz
 * \endcode 
 *   
 *   To run a simulation (and keep the information reported to the standard
 *   output in an external file) the compiled code can be executed as:
 * \code 
 * ./MC-GPU_v1.3.x MC-GPU_v1.3.in | tee MC-GPU_v1.3.out 
 * \endcode 
 * 
 *   All simulation can be executed in the same way using the code compiled for the CPU 
 *   or the GPU (however, the number of histories should be reduced for the CPU to finish 
 *   the simulation in a reasonable time).
 *   To run the simulation in parallel with MPI in multiple GPUs (or CPU cores) in the
 *   current computer the user can execute:
 * \code 
 * mpirun -n 4 ./MC-GPU_v1.3.x MC-GPU_v1.3.in
 * \endcode  
 * 
 *   To use GPUs in different computers, the user must make sure all computers can access the simulation
 *   files and that the libraries are correctly set up in all nodes. 
 *   To execute a simulation (with verbose MPI information being reported):
 * \code  
 * mpirun --tag-output -v -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH -hostfile myhostfile.txt -n 8 
 * /fullPath/MC-GPU_v1.3.x /fullPath/MC-GPU_v1.3.in | tee MC-GPU_v1.3.out
 * \endcode  

 * 
 *   The text file 'hostfile' lists the IP addresses and number of computing slots (GPUs) of the
 *   computers collaborating in the simulation. This file is not necessary when using multiple
 *   GPUs in a single workstation. When using multiple computers, the simulation files should 
 *   be located in a shared drive to make sure every node can access the input data.  
 *   The different workstations must have different host names in order to be differentiated by
 *   the MPI threads. The multiple threads communicate to each other to make sure they don't  
 *   use the same GPU in the same workstation. 
 * 
 *  
 *
 *    \section sec_issues Known issues
 * 
 *   In extremely long simulations, it is theoretically possible to cause an overflow of the counters 
 *   estimating the mean and standard deviation of the material or voxel doses. If this happen, the 
 *   results will be incorrect and even negative or nan values can be reported.
 *

//! Guestimate a good number of blocks to estimate the speed of different generations

//! will not have to wait much. If the speed is not accurately estimated in the speed test
//! some GPUs will simulate longer than others and valuable simulation time will be wasted 
//! in the idle GPUs.
//!
//! In this function the "optimum" number of blocks for the speed test is heuristically 
//! computed as the product of three GPU characteristics:
//!   [2.0] * [number of GPU cores] * [core frequency] * [major CUDA compute capability] + [100]
//!
//! The factor 2.0 is arbitrary and can be modified depending on the case (for short 
//! simulations this value may have to be reduced or the speed test will take longer 
//! than the whole simulation). The constant 100 blocks are added to try to get enough 
//! blocks for a reliable timing of slow GPUs.
//!
//! For example, an NVIDIA GeForce 290 will get:
//!   2.0 * 240 (cores) * 1.24 (GHz) * 1 (major compute capability) + 100 =  695.2 ~  695 blocks
//! An NVIDIA GeForce 580 will get:
//!   2.0 * 512 (cores) * 1.54 (GHz) * 2 (major compute capability) + 100 = 3253.9 ~ 3254 blocks 
//! In total the 580 gets 5.7 times more blocks than the 290.
