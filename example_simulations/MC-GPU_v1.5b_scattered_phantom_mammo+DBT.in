#                
#  This input file simulates a mammogram and 25 projections of a DBT scan (+-25deg). 
#  Main acquistion parameters: 
#     - Source-to-detector distance 65 cm. 
#     - Pixel size 85 micron (= 25.5 cm / 3000 pixels)
#     - Antiscatter grid used only in the mammogram; motion blur used only in the DBT scan.
#     - Breast phantom must be generated using C. Graff's software (hardcoded conversion from binary voxel value to material and density)
#     - Number of histories matches number of x rays in a DBT projection, to reproduce the quantum noise and dose.
#        -- Mammogram simulated with 2/3 the histories in the 25 projections combined (2.04e10*25*2/3 histories)
#        -- It is ok to reduce the number of histories for testing the code!
#        -- Number of histories computed to match the air kerma measured with the real system at the center of a PMMA phantom of equivalent thickness.
#        -- Number of histotries must be re-calculated if the energy spectrum or beam aperture (field size) are changed.
